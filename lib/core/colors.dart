/* Define all colors as constants
so if you want to use Colors.red, first define it in this file as a constant prefixed with 'k' like
const Color kRed = Colors.red;
and then use the constant kRed in the app.
It's better if you could specify where the color is used as the constant name like
const Color kAppBarColor = Colors.red;
